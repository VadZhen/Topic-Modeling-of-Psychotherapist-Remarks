# Topic-Modeling-of-Psychotherapist-Remarks
This project applies BERTopic, a topic modeling technique, to two corpora of psychotherapist remarksâ€”one from a classical approach and one from a modern approach. The goal is to analyze the differences in topics between the two sets of remarks within a psychotherapeutic context.
